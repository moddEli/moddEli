- 👋 Hi, I’m @moddEli
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at Ho Technical University (HTU)

- 😄 Pronouns: ...I, He, His, Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know the term "bug" in programming actually came from a real, live bug? In 1947, a moth got stuck in a Harvard Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction. Grace Hopper and her team removed the insect and documented the event, coining the term "debugging" in the process!

I'm looking forward to enjoy my ride 😎🤩
